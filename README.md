> uHost project - build by using
- Different types of selectors
- property and values
- Combinators
- Box model: content, padding, border, margin
- Styling Width and Hight
- box-sizing: content-box, border-box
- display: block, inline, none
- Pseudo classes and Elements: `:hover`, `::first-letter`
- BEM: CSS naming convention
- Color Function: `rgb()`, `rgba()`
- inherit
- `calc()` function to calculate `width`
- `float` to position elements differently, before `flex-box` was introduced. Use with `clear` to not allow another elements take place of floating element, but this is a Bad Approach. `float` great for positioning images and text.

# Notes
- `id=""` selectors have a higher specificity than class selector or pseudo selectors.
- `!important` overwrite specificity, but it's usually bad practice.

# Tips & Tricks
- Apply `margin: auto` to center group of elements more properly.
